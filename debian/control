Description: unified Python interface into the cloud
 libcloud is a pure Python client library for interacting with many of the
 popular cloud server providers using a unified API. It was created to make it
 easy for developers to build products that work between any of the services
 that it supports.
 .
  * Avoid vendor lock-in
  * Use the same API to talk to many different providers
  * More than 30 supported providers total
  * Four main APIs: Compute, Storage, Load Balancers, DNS
  * Supports Python 2.5, Python 2.6, Python 2.7, PyPy and Python 3
 .
 Resource you can manage with Libcloud are divided in the following categories:
 .
  * Cloud Servers and Block Storage - services such as Amazon EC2 and
    Rackspace Cloud Servers (libcloud.compute.*)
  * Cloud Object Storage and CDN - services such as Amazon S3 and
    Rackspace CloudFiles (libcloud.storage.*)
  * Load Balancers as a Service, LBaaS (libcloud.loadbalancer.*)
  * DNS as a Service, DNSaaS (libcloud.dns.*)
 .
 libcloud was originally created by the folks over at Cloudkick, but has
 since grown into an independent free software project licensed under
 the Apache License (2.0).
